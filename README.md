  * Python 3.10+


## deploy library from PyPi:

```bash

NB: both the spaCy and PyPi teams induce packaging errors
because they have "opinionated" views which conflict against
each other and also don't quite follow the Python packaging
standards.

```bash
python3 demo.py
```

```bash
./venv/bin/jupyter lab
```

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

python3 -m pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to run the Streamlit or JupyterLab demos, or prior to working
locally on the development and testing of this repo:
