## project info

See the project home at: <https://huggingface.co/spaces/DerwenAI/textgraphs>

See the full documentation at: <https://derwen.ai/docs/txg/>

Sample code is provided in `demo.py`


## requirements

  * Python 3.10+


## deploy library from PyPi

To install from [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/textgraphs):

```bash
python3 -m pip install -u textgraphs
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE
```

NB: both the spaCy and PyPi teams induce packaging errors
since they have "opinionated" views which conflict against
each other and also don't quite follow the Python packaging
standards.


## run demos locally

```bash
python3 demo.py
```

```bash
./venv/bin/jupyter lab
```

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```


## install library from a source code repo locally

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

python3 -m pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE
```

to run the Streamlit or JupyterLab demos, also install:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
