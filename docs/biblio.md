["RED<sup>FM</sup>: a Filtered and Multilingual Relation Extraction Dataset"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09802)  
**Pere-Lluís Huguet Cabot**, **Simone Tedeschi**, **Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo**, **Roberto Navigli**  
_ACL_ (2023-06-19)
> Relation Extraction (RE) is a task that identifies relationships between entities in a text, enabling the acquisition of relational facts and bridging the gap between natural language and structured knowledge. However, current RE models often rely on small datasets with low coverage of relation types, particularly when working with languages other than English. In this paper, we address the above issue and provide two new resources that enable the training and evaluation of multilingual RE systems.
