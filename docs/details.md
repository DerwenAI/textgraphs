# Technical Details

Implementation of an LLM-augmented `textgraph` algorithm for
constructing a _lemma graph_ from raw, unstructured text source.

The `TextGraphs` library is based on work developed by
[Derwen](https://derwen.ai/graph)
in 2023 Q2 for customer apps and used in our `Cysoni`
product.
This library integrates code from:

  * [`SpanMarkerNER`](https://github.com/tomaarsen/SpanMarkerNER/)
  * [`spaCy-DBpedia-Spotlight`](https://github.com/MartinoMensio/spacy-dbpedia-spotlight)
  * [`REBEL`](https://github.com/Babelscape/rebel)
  * [`OpenNRE`](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE/)
  * [`qwikidata`](https://github.com/kensho-technologies/qwikidata)
  * [`pulp`](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp)
  * [`spaCy`](https://spacy.io/)
  * [`HF transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)
  * [`PyTextRank`](https://github.com/DerwenAI/pytextrank/)
