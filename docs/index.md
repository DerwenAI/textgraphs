# TextGraphs: raw texts, LLMs, and KGs, oh my!

Welcome to the **TextGraphs** library...

Large language models (LLMs) come from research in natural language.
How can LLMs help improve natural language work?
In particular, how can LLMs benefit use cases that use the results of
natural language parsing to build knowledge graphs?

If you've been reading the news cycle about AI, one obvious through
rather na√Øve response might be
"Just feed your data to ChatGPT and ask it to generate a knowledge graph."
Those who've tried this approach understand its consequences:
incredibly expensive process and poor results, relative to other methods.

However, are there other ways LLMs can augment natural language workflows?
This project results from an ongoing pursuit of that line of inquiry.
With sufficiently narrowed task focus and ample software engineering,
large models can be used to augment specific _components_ of natural
language workflows.
